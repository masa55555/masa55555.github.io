<h1 id="ia-on-the-distance">On the distance</h1>
<p>All of a sudden, we became obsessed with the distance. We know we must keep distance with other people and many of us are observing what is called social distancing strategy. However, on this terminology, we do not seem to be always fully aware that what we perceive as physical distance immediately represents social distance for us.</p>
<p>A Japanese proverb says those who leave become less familiar day by day. Presence matters. The other side of this thinking terrifies us; the longer we confine ourselves in our room, the more we think we feel alone, disconnected from others, siloed, atomised, etc. Individualised? Haven&rsquo;t we been individuals long before we had to stop Friday drinks and stay home? I do not mean you have to live with yourself all day long this year and ponder on the dark side of your own character.</p>
<p>I mean the fear or pain we feel about the isolation can suggest some aspects of what constitutes us as individuals. Believe it or not, we tacitly admit that the otherness of others is embedded in our self. I am me because you never fail to prove to me that you are different from me, and you tell me with your gestures, voice, or words that you recognise me. Living in society, we are so much accustomed to this mode of mutual definition or recognition as individuals that we feel something in ourselves erodes when this interdependence suddenly retreats. Probably, there can be other ways of living as individuals if you live in a deserted island for a long time. I simply mean here that we seem to handle automatically the process of mutual definition or recognition when we live in society.</p>
<p>What we consider as the flow of natural interaction was interrupted everywhere by the order or strong request to keep distance with one another. If we feel other people have become distant these days, it is probably because we assume that those who are out of reach or invisible could not or should not engage closely, frequently, strongly, and intuitively enough with us as individuals. The development in technologies would not replace the handshake, hugs (can we replace them fully with emoji), or saying hello to your neighbours, because it had been so. However, as long as we maintain the interdependence or mutual recognition to be individuals in society, that belief may change. Those who use messenger apps already accept the semi-tangible presence of others through smartphone. Talking over the transparent plastic sheet in a grocery store is not considered rude. If we are forced to stay apart for months or years, we could further turn the technologies into the prothesis for daily interaction that we would feel natural, or social norms could shift towards a more contactless and euphemistic communication.</p>
